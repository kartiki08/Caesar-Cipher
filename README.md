# Cryptography Program
An I/O program (run through "crypto.c") can currently use two cryptography methods summarized below. To use the functions without the I/O program, please refer to the documentation, "crypto.h".

Caesar Cipher:
Encodes and decodes a message, using one of the earliest known ciphers which shifts each letter a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Pig Latin:
A function that takes an input and output strings and overwrites the content of output with the encoding of input.
