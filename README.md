# Cryptography Programs
This is a module full of cryptography programs:

Caesar Cipher:
An I/O program that encodes and decodes a message, using one of the earliest known ciphers which shifts each letter a certain number of places down the alphabet. Currently, the program only takes an 80 character long message. 

Pig Latin:
A program that takes an input and output string which overwrites the content of output with the encoding of input.
