# Caesar-Cipher
An I/O Program that encodes and decodes a message, using one of the earliest known ciphers which shifts each letter a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Currently, the program only takes an 80 character long message. 
I will update the program to accept message of any length through memory allocation.
